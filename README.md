MAPF-LNS2: Fast Repairing for Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search


MAPF-LNS2 is an efficient algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). 
More details can be found in our paper at AAAI 2022 [1].

This software is an advanced version and a superset of MAPF-LNS (https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS); that is, it also contains Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search [2]. 

## Usage
The code requires the external libraries  
**Boost** (https://www.boost.org/) and **Eigen** (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).  
Below is the recommended Ubuntu (Linux) setup and build workflow.

```bash
# install prerequisites
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build \
                   libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev \
                   libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev

# configure & compile (out‑of‑source build with Ninja)
mkdir -p build-linux
cmake -S . -B build-linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-linux -j"$(nproc)" # same as: ninja -C build-linux

# run
./build-linux/lns -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen \
                  -o test -k 150 --outputPaths=paths.txt \
                  --destoryStrategy=SAT --maxIterations 20
```
Then, you are able to run the code:

```
./lns -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test -k 150   --outputPaths=paths.txt --destoryStrategy=SAT --maxIterations 20 
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file name (no need for file extension)
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit
- outputPaths: the output file that contains the paths

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./lns --help
```

We provide example instance files "random-32-32-20.map" and "random-32-32-20-random-1.scen" in the repo. 
More instances can be download from the [MAPF benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).
All the experiments in the paper used in instances from the benchmark except for Experiment 5, 
for which the instances are in folder "instances". 
In particular, the format of the scen files is explained [here](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html). 
For a given number of agents k, the first k rows of the scen file are used to generate the k pairs of start and target locations.

## Credits

The software was developed by Jiaoyang Li and Zhe Chen based on [MAPF-LNS](https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS).

The rule-based MAPF solvers (i.e., PPS, PIBT, and winPIBT) inside the software were borrowed from 
https://github.com/Kei18/pibt/tree/v1.3
